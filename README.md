# About the game: Frogger

In this game, the goal for the player is to reach the water without colliding with an enemy: a bug. The enemies move at different speeds (randomly assigned) on the paved block part of the field. When the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and 30 points will be deducted from the score. 

An alternative goal is to increase the player's score by collecting gems that are randomly
placed along the field. 3 gems are placed (randomly) in the field once at the beggining of the game, and every time that the player reaches the water and the game re-starts; the previous score is kept throigh the new game each time the player reaches the water.

Blue Gem = 30 points.
Green Gem  = 20 pints.


# How to Play

The player can move left, right, up and down using the keyboard's keys.

The player can only move within the field.


# About the Game: Object Oriented Javascript

The goal of this game is to implement best Object Oriented Javascript practices, including the adequate use of scopes, closures, prototype chains, the object decorator pattern, and classes (functional, prototypal, pseudoclassical, superclasses, and/or pseudoclassical subclasses).
